This project is experimental implementation for a cross-version Airdrop using Zeroconf. 

I started out with Python to build the desktop application from file-sharing on local network, but didn't really like the desktop app
experience. 

Eventually, I decided to move on and use Electron to build the Desktop App to make it easier to hold the "cross-platform" part. 
There are still many challenges involved and the project is still ongoing. You can find it at [manthan787/hitch](https://github.com/Manthan787/hitch).

However, if you'd rather read Python than Javascript, this project will give you the bare minimum to build an Airdrop using zeroconf.

Cheers!
